Installation of tscreen

1.) Configuration
-----------------------------
Create a build directory, change to it, and run cmake <path-to-source>

  mkdir ./build ; (cd build ; cmake ..)


If the defaults look okay to you, proceed. Otherwise, use the CMake TUI
to fine-tune installation options.

  ccmake ..

2.) Actually compiling
-----------------------
Type make!

  make


3.) where to install
--------------------
You may well run tscreen from your private binary directory and with a
private socket directory like $HOME/.tscreen. But to have a full featured
tscreen and (from a users point of view) more secure pty's you should
consult a system administrator and discuss installing tscreen setuid-root
in some globally accessible directory like /usr/local/bin.

Consider this, when deciding whether you install tscreen setuid-root:
- On some machines root privileges are required to open pty's.
- Pty's should be owned by the user, so that she can do chmod to prevent
  intruder attacks. The PTYs used by tscreen will remain world read-writable
  if tscreen is not installed setuid-root.
- Some commands only work properly when the pty is owned by the user.
  These include mesg and biff.
- The ^At feature may need to lseek and read the kernel file to retrieve
  the load average.
- On most machines utmp slots can only be created/manipulated with root
  privileges. Users will appear to be logged on the primary terminal
  instead of the tscreen windows, if tscreen is not installed setuid-root.
- Multi-user tscreen sessions are only allowed when tscreen has a root-s-bit.
- If tscreen sockets of multiple users are kept in one directory (e.g.
  /tmp/screens), this directory must be world writable when tscreen is not
  installed setuid-root. Any user can remove or abuse any socket then.


4.) doc/tscreen.1 & doc/tscreen.texinfo
-------------------------------------
The man page doc/tscreen.1 should go to /usr/local/man/man1, or some similar
directory. It should format nicely with nroff -man. If it does not, then
try removing extra dots with: sed -e 's/^\.\././' < tscreen.1 | nroff -man
The info page doc/tscreen.texinfo contains basically the same information as
the man-page, we may have missed one or another thing in one of the files.
If so, e-mail me.

5.) Config files
----------------------------------
The file data/tscreenrc are instructive samples that
demonstrate what can and/or should be done from your private .tscreenrc and from
$ETCTSCREENRC -- do not just copy them. Read them.  Look through the
etctscreenrc file for system wide defaults that you like to set. e.g.
autodetach off, startup_message off, vbell on, ...

6.) terminfo/screeninfo.src & terminfo/screencap
------------------------------------------------
Every now and then we update the termcap/terminfo entries for tscreen.
E.g. keycodes were added in 3.6.0 -- thus you check that your termcap/terminfo
database is up to date. See the README in the terminfo subdirectory.

7.) have fun
------------
To get an idea what the basic tscreen commands are, read the file README.
